# Observed LIFX network protocol

It is a work in progress and is not, in any way, affiliated or related to LIFX
Labs.

Please note that this is based on the original firmware, not the recent v1.2
update.  The main difference is that the TCP connection packets now all happen
over UDP; I'll update this doc more thoroughly when I get a chance.

## Description of the various stages

### Discovery

The apps start by sending UDP "discovery" packets to the network broadcast
address, port 56700.  They do this repeatedly until a bulb responds by sending
a UDP packet back to you on port 56700. Packets are identified via its type (of
0x03).

The first response which matches this is what I'm using as the "controller"
bulb.  The controller appears to continue sending UDP packets, but I have not
yet dug in to these; my assumption is that they are general announcements to
the rest of the network in case there are multiple apps running which want to
control the bulbs.

### Registration

An unconfigured bulb will listen at 172.16.0.1 and act as an access point,
hosting a secure network with the name "LIFX Bulb" and password of 'lifx1234'.

Configuration of a bulb involves connecting to the bulb's hosted network and
sending a "set access point" message to the bulb. This message contains the
information it needs to join your existing wireless network infrastructure
(such as SSID and password). Networks using WEP security are not supported.

After receipt of the message, the bulb will shut down the hosted network
and attempt connection to the existing wireless network infrastructure.

The "get access point" message can be used to enumerate wireless access points
visible by the bulb.

### Control

After finding a controller bulb, open a TCP connection to it on port 56700.
All commands are sent down this stream.

### Feedback messages

The controller bulb appears to send data to the network as UDP packets, but it
also sends similar packets down the TCP connection.  These packets conform to
the common elements detailed above.

If you have more than one bulb, you will get a packet for each bulb with the
second address field changed to tell you which bulb the packet is referring to.

## Packet frame

The network protocol uses UDP and TCP in various places, but there seems to be
a common packet format used. Packet field data appears to be of mixed
endianness.

```c
packet
{
  uint16 size;              // LE
  uint16 protocol;
  uint32 reserved1;         // Always 0
  byte   target_mac_address[6];
  uint16 reserved2;         // Always 0
  byte   site[6];           // MAC address of gateway PAN controller bulb
  uint16 reserved3;         // Always 0
  uint64 timestamp;
  uint16 packet_type;       // LE
  uint16 reserved4;         // Always 0

  varies payload;           // Documented below per packet type
}
```

## Description of packet types
 
### <a name="0x02"></a>0x02 - Get PAN gateway

Sent to a network (UDP broadcast) or bulb (TCP direct) to retrieve its PAN
gateway state.

This packet is typically broadcast to discover gateway bulbs on the local
network. (UDP datagram, port 56700.) As the destination bulb is unknown,
the packet frame's address field is zeroed out.

#### Payload (0 bytes)

```c
payload {
  // None
}
```

#### Subsequent actions

Will hopefully cause a packet type [0x03](#0x03) to be sent back;
apps should treat the originator of this response as a PAN gateway bulb for
further communication.

### <a name="0x03"></a>0x03 - PAN gateway

(direct or broadcast). One packet describes one gateway bulb (i.e. you will
receive a few of these packets).

```c
payload {
  SERVICE service;
  uint32 port;     // LE
}

enum SERVICE : byte

#### Subsequent actions

After receiving this packet, I open a TCP connection to the originator on TCP
port 56700 for subsequent communication.

}
```

### <a name="0x27"></a>0x27 - Set Factory Test Mode

```


### <a name="0x65"></a>0x65 - Get light state

Sent to a bulb to request its current light state (which includes its color, dim
level, power level, label, and tags).

#### Payload (0 bytes)

```

#### Subsequent actions

Will generally be followed by one or more [0x6b](#0x6b) packets in response.

### <a name="0x66"></a>0x66 - Set light color

Sent to a bulb to configure its light color. Upon receipt, the bulb will fade
towards the new color using specified timing information.

#### Payload (13 bytes)

```c
payload {
  byte stream;        // Unknown, potential "streaming" mode toggle? Set to
                      // 0x00 for now.
  uint16 hue;         // LE NOTE: Wraps around at 0xff 0xff back to 0x00 0x00
                      // which is a primary red colour.
  uint16 saturation;  // LE
  uint16 brightness;  // LE
  uint16 kelvin;      // LE i.e. colour temperature (whites wheel in apps)
  uint32 fade_time;   // LE Length of fade action, in milliseconds
}
```

Note that for the "whites", apps always sets hue and saturation to 0x00. 
The white colour appears to have a fairly narrow range, such that 0-10 is
very yellow, 14 is a natural white, then 15-30 fades to blue.  Anything
beyond that seems to be very blue.

### <a name="0x67"></a>0x67 - Set waveform

Sent to a bulb to configure its "waveform"; i. e. a pattern of
alternation between two colors.  One color is the original color, and
the other color is specified in this message.

#### Payload (21 bytes)

```c
payload {
  byte stream;       // Unusued; set to 0
  byte transient;
  uint16 hue;        // LE
  uint16 saturation; // LE
  uint16 brightness; // LE
  uint16 kelvin;     // LE
  uint32 period;     // LE; length of one cycle in milliseconds
  float cycles;      // LE; number of times to cycle through pattern before stopping
  int16 duty_cycle;  // LE
  WAVEFORM waveform;
}

enum WAVEFORM : byte
{
  SAW = 0,
  SINE = 1,
  HALF_SINE = 2,
  TRIANGLE = 3,
  PULSE = 4
}
```

If _transient_ is 1, the color returns to the original color of the
light, after the specified number of _cycles_.  If _transient_ is
0, the light is left set to _color_ after the specified number of
_cycles_.

If _duty_cycle_ is 0, an equal amount of time is spent on the original
color and the new _color_.  If _duty_cycle_ is positive, more time is
spent on the original color.  If _duty_cycle_ is negative, more time
is spent on the new color.

### <a name="0x68"></a>0x68 - Set dim (absolute)
